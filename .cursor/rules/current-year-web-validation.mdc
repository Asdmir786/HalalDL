# Current-Year Knowledge Rule

- For time-sensitive or external facts (tool versions, API changes, release notes, docs behavior), verify with live web sources before answering.
- Prefer official sources first (project docs, GitHub releases, vendor docs), then secondary sources if needed.
- Do not rely only on model memory for "latest/current" questions.
- Include a brief note of what was checked (source + date relevance) when providing version/release guidance.
- If web access is unavailable, explicitly say so and label any version/date details as potentially stale.

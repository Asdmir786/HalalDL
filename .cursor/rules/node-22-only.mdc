# Node 22 Only

- Use Node.js `22.x` for all project commands, installs, and CI guidance.
- Do not suggest or apply upgrades to Node 23/24/25+ for this repo.
- Keep `@types/node` on `^22` to match runtime APIs.
- If a package suggests newer Node features, prefer a compatible package version rather than changing Node major.
- Mention Node-version compatibility when recommending dependency updates.

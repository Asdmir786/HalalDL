# Verification Standard

- Use `pnpm check` as the default verification command after substantive code changes.
- Treat `pnpm check` as the primary validation step before reporting work complete.
- If `pnpm check` cannot run (environment/tooling issue), report why and run the closest subset checks possible (for example `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, or `pnpm cargo:check`).
- Include a short note in the response stating whether verification was run and the result.

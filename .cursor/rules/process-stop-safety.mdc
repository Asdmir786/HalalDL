# Process Stop Safety

- Do not terminate or interrupt a running process unless both conditions are true:
  - At least 3 minutes have elapsed since the process started.
  - No new output/progress has appeared during that period.
- Before stopping any process, re-read the terminal output to confirm it is truly stalled.
- Prefer continued polling with reasonable backoff when status is uncertain.
- If termination is necessary, explain the stall evidence before stopping.
